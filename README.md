some of my actual code that I worked on in projects:

first project - strategy game			January 2016 - February 2016
This was my first programming project.
It's a strategy game build in PyGame. I mainly worked on the map and the game logics.
The game is not complete but the basics of the game works.

project - data application			March 2016 - April 2016


project - mobile application			June 2016 - July 2016
A mobile application about the amount and locations of bike containers and information about stolen bikes in Rotterdam. 
Also there is an option to save the location of you own bike and save a reminder with the location in your calender.
